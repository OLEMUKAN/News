## Use Case in Ugandan Context

### Problem Statement
Universities across Uganda face significant challenges in communication between administration and students. Current methods include:

1. **Physical Notice Boards**: Information is location-restricted, easily missed, and cannot be updated quickly. Students must physically visit these boards, which are often overcrowded or outdated.

2. **Scattered Social Media**: Important announcements get lost among unrelated messages in WhatsApp groups or social media platforms. The lack of organization means critical information is easily overlooked.

3. **Unreliable Word-of-Mouth**: Critical information becomes distorted as it spreads through informal channels, leading to misinformation and confusion among students.

4. **Unofficial Sources**: Students often receive unverified information from non-authoritative channels, causing uncertainty about the legitimacy of announcements.

These issues have real consequences: students miss registration deadlines, are unaware of schedule changes, and fail to receive important announcements that directly impact their academic journey. For example, at Ndejje University, students have missed examination schedule changes, scholarship opportunities, and campus security alerts due to ineffective communication channels.

### Solution
UNews addresses these challenges by:

- Providing a single, verified source of university information accessible from anywhere
- Enabling real-time updates that reach all students simultaneously via their smartphones
- Creating a searchable archive of all announcements for easy reference
- Allowing interaction through comments for students to seek clarification
- Supporting offline access to previously viewed content for areas with poor connectivity
- Empowering administrators to publish urgent information immediately

For example, when Ndejje University needs to announce an unexpected campus closure due to infrastructure issues, the information can be published immediately to UNews, ensuring all students receive the critical update regardless of their location. Similarly, important academic deadlines, guest lectures, and facility changes can be communicated efficiently through categorized announcements.

## üîç Scope and Limitations

### Current Scope
This MVP version of UNews focuses specifically on:

1. **Basic News Delivery System**: A functioning news feed with article details that allows students to read official university announcements
2. **Fundamental User Interaction**: Comments, saves, and reactions to facilitate basic engagement with content
3. **Essential Admin Tools**: Simple article creation and publishing interface for authorized university staff
4. **Core User Experience**: Material Design interface, theme options, and offline functionality for basic usability

The application addresses the primary need for reliable information dissemination within Ugandan universities while maintaining a feasible development scope for our team of three members.

### Limitations

The current implementation deliberately excludes:

1. **Push Notifications**: While valuable for timely alerts, implementation of real-time notifications is beyond the current scope and would require additional backend infrastructure.

2. **Advanced Analytics**: Admin dashboards for content engagement metrics will be addressed in future versions. The current focus is on content delivery rather than measurement.

3. **Direct Image Uploads**: Current version uses image URLs rather than device uploads to simplify the implementation and reduce storage requirements.

4. **Rich Text Editing**: Admin content creation uses basic text fields rather than a full WYSIWYG editor to ensure reliability and simplicity.

5. **Advanced User Management**: Detailed role permissions are simplified to Admin/Student binary roles rather than a more complex hierarchy that might be needed in larger institutions.

6. **Live Events**: Features like live streams for university events are not included due to bandwidth and implementation complexity.

7. **Multimedia Content**: Support for video content is not implemented to keep the application lightweight and accessible on lower-end devices common among Ugandan students.

These limitations were established to create a focused MVP that addresses the core use case of reliable information dissemination while maintaining realistic development scope for a student project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Firebase Authentication with Jetpack Compose
**Problem**: Integrating Firebase Authentication into the Compose lifecycle and maintaining authentication state across screens proved difficult. Initial implementations caused memory leaks and inconsistent UI states.

**Solution**: Created a dedicated AuthViewModel with StateFlow to observe authentication state changes. Used `collectAsState()` in composables to react to auth state changes and implemented proper lifecycle management for Firebase listeners. This approach ensured that authentication state was consistently maintained across configuration changes and navigation events.

### Challenge 2: Efficient Image Loading in Low-Bandwidth Environment
**Problem**: Loading high-resolution images caused performance issues, excessive data usage, and memory leaks, particularly problematic given the limited internet connectivity in many Ugandan university campuses.

**Solution**: Implemented Coil for efficient image loading with caching, lazy loading in LazyColumn, and thumbnail resizing. Added placeholder and error handling for poor network conditions. Images are now progressively loaded and cached, significantly reducing data usage and improving performance on lower-end devices common among students.

### Challenge 3: Handling Offline State for Rural Students
**Problem**: App became unusable when network connection was lost, which is a frequent occurrence for students in rural areas of Uganda.

**Solution**: Leveraged Firestore's offline persistence capabilities to cache previously loaded articles. Implemented UI indicators for offline mode and disabled write operations when offline. Added data synchronization logic for when connection is restored. This ensures students can continue accessing critical information even without consistent internet access.

### Challenge 4: Adapting to Varying Device Capabilities
**Problem**: Wide variation in student device capabilities (from entry-level to high-end smartphones) made it difficult to ensure consistent performance and user experience.

**Solution**: Implemented adaptive loading strategies that detect device capabilities and adjust accordingly. Used lazy loading, minimal animations on lower-end devices, and efficient state management to reduce memory usage. The application now performs well across the range of devices typically used by Ugandan university students.

### Challenge 5: Learning Curve for Jetpack Compose
**Problem**: As a team new to Jetpack Compose, we faced a steep learning curve that impacted development velocity and initially resulted in non-optimal implementations.

**Solution**: Established a structured learning approach with weekly team knowledge-sharing sessions. Created reusable UI components to enforce consistency and reduce duplication. Implemented progressive refactoring sprints to improve code quality as our understanding of Compose deepened. This approach enabled us to overcome the initial learning challenges while maintaining development momentum.
